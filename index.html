				<strong style="font-size: 20px;">Dynamic programming </strong> is a technique that combines the correctness of complete
				search and the efficiency of greedy algorithms. Dynamic programming can
				be applied if the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can
				be solved independently.
				<br><br>
				There are two uses for dynamic programming:
				<br><br>
				• Finding an optimal solution: We want to find a solution that is as large
				as possible or as small as possible.
				<br><br>
				• Counting the number of solutions: We want to calculate the total number
				of possible solutions.
				<br><br>
				We will first see how dynamic programming can be used to find an optimal
				solution, and then we will use the same idea for counting the solutions.
				Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone in every competitive
				programmer’s career. While the basic idea is simple, the challenge is how to apply
				dynamic programming to different problems. This chapter introduces a set of
				classic problems that are a good starting point.
